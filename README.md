# Project-Resources
List of resources for project so I don't need to find them later

## Project 1 Requirements

Requirements will be listed followed by resources to fulfill those requirements

### AT LEAST TWO server-side APIs

[List of some public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

### Must use CSS framework *OTHER THAN* Bootstrap

[List of some CSS libraries](https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks)

### Use AT LEAST ONE new third-party API

Probably means a Javascript library other than jQuery, but we can still use jQuery

[Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/api/) (actually merged with jQuery to form the JS foundation in 2016 but they have their own library)

[Google Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) Apparently used by some big companies

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) We'll cover this later in the course but might be worth checking out to get some experience

### Have a polished, MOBILE-FIRST UI

Either we customize the styles in CSS depending on viewport or we use a CSS library that does so for us. Probably the latter since its easier

Some examples:

[Pure CSS](https://purecss.io/)

[Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)

### Must meet good quality coding standards

At the end of the day, "good quality coding standards" is subjective, and general coding style values readability over all else. Probably needs a decent amount of white space between operators, semicolons even if we don't need them, clearly named variables, and consistency. Keeping the character count per line maybe below 200 is good, but is again, subjective.

### Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts

Modals seem to be included with most CSS libraries, so we can just look up how to use them depending on which CSS framework we choose

### Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

Not sure where else to deploy

### Must be interactive
